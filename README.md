#Numbers in Words, in Ruby 

##About
This project was completed by Katharine Chen for the Ruby BDD assessment at Epicodus. 

##Description
The project is to create a method that translates numbers in numeric form into written words. For example, it would translate 384 into "three hundred eighty four". The goal is to make the method work up to 1 trillion. 

Initially, the problem was solved using the case statement, however the solution appeared to be filled with huge numbes and overly verbose. As such, the code was refactored greatly. 

##Functionality
```ruby
numbers_in_words(123) ##return "One hundred twenty four"
```
