<h1>Numbers in Words, in Ruby</h1>
<p>Written by Katharine Chen</p>

<h3>About</h3>
This project is for the Ruby BDD assessment at Epicodus.

The project is to create a method that translates numbers in numeric form into written words. For example, it would translate 384 into "three hundred eighty four". The goal is to make the method work up to 1 trillion. 

Initially, the problem was solved using the case statement, however the solution appeared to be filled with huge numbes and overly verbose. As such, the code was refactored greatly. 

<h3>Functionality</h3>

numbers_in_words(124) will equal "One hundred twenty four"
